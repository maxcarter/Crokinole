## Rules of Crokinole
 
During their turn, the player will place one disc on the start line anywhere in his/her quadrants. When ready the player will flick the disc towards the pot (the center of the board). The disc must hit one of the opposing discs in order to remain on the board. If the disc does not hit an opposing disc, the disc becomes null and is removed from the board. If there is no opposing discs on the board, then simply aim for the pot, or the highest points possible, and wherever the disc lands is where it stays (until possibly bumped by an opposing disc). The point scheme is as followed:

* If the disk lands on the start line, or in the ditch, it is worth 0 points.
* If the disk lands in between the start line and the 5 point transition line, it is worth 5 points.
* If the disk lands in between the 5 point transition line and the 10 point transition line, it is worth 10 points.
* If the disk lands in between the 10 point transition line and the pot, it is worth 15 points.
* If the disk lands in the pot, it is removed for counting and is worth 20 points

When each player is all out of discs, the game is over and you must count points. Any two opposing discs in the same point section of the board cancel each other out. Whatever pieces are left have their points counter. The player with the higher score wins.

Crokinole: The Forgotten Game follows all these rules in an easy to use interface. For instructions on how to play, simply click on the How To Play button during the second screen of the game. The game also includes many features such as a pegs-off mode that disables the protecting pegs around the pot. Additionally, for single player mode, there is a computer AI. This AI is only a medium-level AI to make the game more fun. In the future there will be three levels to choose from: easy, medium and hard. Easy will simply be a random set of angles and numbers for the enemy disc to move. Medium will be as the AI is now, a combination of random and math. The medium-level AI always shoots towards the closest opposing disc. Hard will be almost impossible to beat. Every turn, the hard AI will calculate collision angles with every piece on the board and then choose the most accurate shot and power level.

This version of Crokinole: The Forgotten Game is a only a beta version, however it is completely playable. The full version will include many more features and bug fixes.
